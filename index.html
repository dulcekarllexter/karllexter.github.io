    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        I am a third-year college student majoring in English Language Studies. Ever since grade school, I’ve had a deep passion for the arts, whether it’s writing, drawing (digital or traditional), or editing photos and videos. Even though these are my creative pursuits, I am also eager to explore new horizons in other fields.
      </p>
      <p>
        My strengths include brainstorming, analyzing, and collaborating with a team. I have consistently shown my leadership skills since my elementary years, and alongside these skills, I remain committed to my academics. In senior high school, I graduated with high honors, and in college, I have been a consistent President’s Lister where I maintained a GWA of 1.11 in my sophomore year.
